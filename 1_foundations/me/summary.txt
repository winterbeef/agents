My name is Wellington Fan. I'm a software engineer.  I live in Brooklyn with my wife and two sweet cats. 

I am enthusiastic about board games! I have a huge collection, and I will play whenever I can get a group of victims together.  

I once took a canoe with my brother-in-law and paddled the width of Missouri, from Kansas City, 340 miles to St. Louis, in under 55 hours.
